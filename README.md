# ical2rem
The original iCal to Remind script, first released in 2005.

Reads iCal files and outputs remind-compatible files.   Tested ONLY with
  calendar files created by Mozilla Calendar/Sunbird. Use at your own risk.

## License
In 2005, this was released with the Gnu Public License V2.  However, I am changing it to the MIT License, since that provides greater freedom to do with this code what you want.

## How I use Remind and Google Calendar together

  - My family has a Google Email domain, and our email addresses all end in the same domain. We all use Google Calendars and I want to mail reminders to each of the family members containing both Google Calendar and .reminder information.
  - Under my ~/.rem/ directory each family member has a directory.  Each directory contains a standard remind file called 'reminders' that at the very least has the line "INCLUDE /home/jalcorn/.rem/<username>/ical2rem" and flag files indicating whether they want Daily or Weekly reminders.  My reminders files references my standard .reminders file, and I also have a flag so if I run a Test run I'll get it.  There's actually a lot more files (I have a big family).

  - bin/getgooglecals.sh runs out of crontab and downloads whatever calendars I want. Note that we can also download organization calendars, I've included a public one here (Cleveland Heights Vocal Music Department calendar).
  - dailyreminders.sh is linked to weeklyreminders.sh and testreminders.sh so I can run it in different modes. The concatenate the various calendar outputs as a single remind file then send the reminders via email.

## Recurring Calendar entries and Remind

There's been a long standing bug in ical2rem.pl - older recurring calendar entries were not detected by the script
so the entries wouldn't be output to the remind file. I handled recurring entries and made sure only one would appear by manipulating
the lead time, but the perl ICal parser wasn't handling older calendar entries.

I discovered a python module that does exactly what I need.  It reads and calculates all the RRULE entries, and can output 
calendar entries that occur within a specified time frame. I wrote the simple cal_upcoming_events.py script to
read in the iCalendar file and output a simplified file that has all the calculated entries.  The UID isn't changed
so my code that manipulates the lead time to make sure only one instance shows up in the remind output is still good.

I call the new script on the original iCal file and pass the output to ical2rem.pl:

```bash
> bin/cal_upcoming_events.py -i calendars/full/justin.ics -o - -b 0 -a 30 | ical2rem.pl --lead-time 30 | remind -q -
```

Here's the docstring from the new script:
```
"""Ingests a icalendar and outputs all simplified calendar
    that includes only events that occur within a span of time

Uses the module recurring_ical_events to calculate any older
    recurring events that have occurrences within the defined span of time.

Args:
    infile: The file to read

    outfile: the file to write

    before: number of days before today to start the span

    after: number of days after today to start the span


"""
```

## Revision History
### Version 0.8 2024-10-16

### Version 0.7 2024-09-04
  - ISSUE 8: New version of remind complains if _sfun isn't defined. Output a header
	to define a function that does nothing if the function doesn't exist.

      - BUG: leadtime for recurring events had a max of 4 instead of DEFAULT_LEAD_TIME
